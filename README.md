# Spring core from scratch. Configuration and Dependency Injection (IoC)
In this repository you are going to learn about Spring core and how Spring implements DI. You are going to work with beans which are just objects through XML file or Config.class or Annotation. After that I am going to implement DI based on Inversion of Control. We are going to see different design patterns like **Singleton, Protoype and Request**.

Let me introduce first about DI: **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. Creating objects directly within the class is inflexible because it commits the class to particular objects and makes it impossible to change the instantiation later independently from the class. DI uses Inversion of Control principle.


**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle that allows classes to be loosely coupled and, therefore, easier to test and maintain. IoC refers to transferring the control of objects and their dependencies from the main program to a container or framework.

## Topics covered: 
- XML Based Configuration
- Annotation based Configuration
- Java based Configuration
- @Component, @Configuration, @Bean
- Dependency Injection
- Setter & Construcor Injection
- Spring bean Scopes. Design Patterns: Singleton, Protoype and Request
- Spring bean Lifecycle
